Needed:

- Unit tests should not require a database.  Need to write a separate set of unit tests that are actually unit tests. 
- Integration tests (currently called 'unit tests') should work consistently when run back-to-back, which they currently don't always from the command line. 

Future:

- Execute everything in transactions.
- Separate out dependencies a little more cleanly. 
- Take better advantage of guice, especially for unit tests. 
- Re-adding integration tests for MySQL.
- Better command-line Javadocs/Findbugs/Checkstyle support for CI.
- Support for Jython, JRuby, and Scala.
- Add maintenance support.
- Simplify integration test setup.
- Restructure for easier unit testing (e.g., taking streams directly instead of objects that we simply get streams from.)

Under Consideration (major undertakings and probably not worth it):

- Porting from maven to ant, mostly because our growing tools for CI are largely written to facilitate ant+ivy.
- Moving testing framework from TestNG to JUnit, possibly only for unit testing.  We aren't taking advantage of a lot of TestNG's features, and the two have moved closer together in the features we are using.
